	<p> Suay is a website created for women by women. It was developed to save time when picking out outfits in the morning by allowing women to have them ready beforehand. 
		This website allows you to create and save outfits based on clothes from your closet to have outfits for a long day of working hard, being a strong, independent force to be reckoned with. 
		Suay also provides styling tips and tricks to help coordinate colors, define dress codes, and spark inspiration. 
		Moreover, we wanted to create a hub for women to to help women, where we ask that any clothing that hasn't been worn in a while be donated to other women who may need them. </p>
